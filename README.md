# zigbee2mqtt with socat for remote zigbee

changed from deconz-socat to zigbee2mqtt-socat and changed to latest branch fork from [deconz-socat](https://github.com/peterforeman/deconz-socat)

Instead of using a locally-connected zigbee device (usbstick/CC2531), we can use a serial device mapped over the network with ser2net or socat and then map it to a local zwave serial device with socat.

Please [report issues on github](https://github.com/peterforeman/zigbee2mqtt-socat/issues).

## Getting Started

This docker container ensures that:
 - socat is running
 - zigbee2mqtt is running

If there are any failures, both socat and zigbee2mqtt will be restarted.

### Prerequisites

See the normal zigbee2mqtt docker container readme.

### Installing

The container needs some extra parameters as described below.

All [koenkk-zigbee2mqtt](https://hub.docker.com/r/koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/) image options are available and on top of that a few others have been added.

# Basic options

**DEBUG_VERBOSE**=0

Set to 1 to see more information
Default: 0

**PAUSE_BETWEEN_CHECKS**=2

In seconds, how much time to wait between checking running processes.
Default: 2

**LOG_TARGET**=/log.log

Path to log file. Omit to write logs to stdout.
Default: stdout

# Socat options

**SOCAT_ZIGBEE_TYPE**="tcp"

**SOCAT_ZIGBEE_HOST**="192.168.5.5"

**SOCAT_ZIGBEE_PORT**="7676"

Where socat should connect to. Will be used as tcp://192.168.5.5:7676

**SOCAT_ZIGBEE_LINK**="/dev/zigbee"

What the zigbee device should be mapped to. Use this in your zigbee2mqtt configuration file.

## Deployment

Example socat on host system:
```
/usr/bin/socat /dev/zigbee,b115200,rawer,echo=0 tcp-listen:7677,reuseaddr,su=nobody
```

Example zigbee.service (debian systemd) on host system:
```
[Unit]
Description=zigbee socat
After=network.target auditd.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat /dev/zigbee,b115200,rawer,echo=0 tcp-listen:7677,reuseaddr,su=nobody
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
Restart=always
Type=simple

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=zigbee.service
```
